              Building a Thriving Community:We envision a close-knit community
              of students who are passionate about technology. This community
              will be a safe space for sharing knowledge, solving problems, and
              inspiring one another to reach new heights in the world of coding.
            </li>
            <li>
              Promoting Collaboration: We believe that the best solutions are
              often born through collaboration. Our vision is to facilitate
              collaboration by organizing group projects, workshops, and coding
              meetups, allowing members to work together, learn from each other,

        <h2 className="heading">Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          The journey of the Techno Club began with a vision to create a
          thriving ecosystem where students could explore their passion for
          coding, cultivate new skills, and collaborate on groundbreaking tech
          projects. We realized the need for a space where aspiring
          technologists could connect, share their knowledge, and embark on a
          journey of continuous learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an answer to this need, the Techno Club was born. Since our
          inception, we have been committed to nurturing a community that goes
          beyond the classroom, where students can express their creativity,
          engage in hands-on coding experiences, and interact with like-minded
          individuals.
